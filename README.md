# Code Refactor Starter Code

In this assignment, I refactored the code to meet accessibility standards.
1. Semantic HTML elements
2. Elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and position
3. Image elements have accessible alt attributes
4. Heading attributes fall in sequential order
5. Title element is concise and descriptive

Grading requirements included technical acceptance criteria, deployment, application quality, and repository quality.
